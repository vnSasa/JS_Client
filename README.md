# JS_Client

## OUR TASK:

### 1. Write a code that:

a) On the html page, fill in each of the three lists (ul), after clicking on the button, any text;

b) On the same page will display the total number of all (li).

### 2. On the html page, after clicking on the button, will provide a red background for external links (those that contain the protocol (`http: //`, `ftp: //`)), adding an external-red class. All links without protocol or starting with http://internal.com are considered internal.
